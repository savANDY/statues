## Installation

```bash
npm install
```
In order for the app to work properly, you must create a `.env` file at the **root** folder with the following variables:
```REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY = 
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID = 
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID = 
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID = 
```

The values are sensitive so you should have your own firebase console configuration for trying in local.
